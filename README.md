# funding-service-design-utils
Shared library for funding service design apps.

This library can be installed into other python repos and the packages used by those repos.

# Dev setup
In order to run the unit tests, setup a virtual env and install requirements
1. Checkout the code
1. Setup a venv and activate: `python3 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate`
1. Install dev requirements: `pip install --upgrade pip && pip install -r requirements-dev.txt`
1. Install pre-commit hook: `pre-commit install`
1. Run tests with `pytest`
1. If you add any packages needed by services that consume `fsd_utils`, add them into `pyproject.yaml`.

# Releasing
To create a new release of funding-service-design-utils:
1. Make and test your changes as normal in this repo
2. Update the `version` tag in `pyproject.toml`
3. Push your changes to `main`.
4. The Action at `.github/workflows/test-and-tag.yml` will create a new tag and release, named for the version in `pyproject.toml`. This is triggered automatically on a push to main.
5. That action will also push this tag up to PyPI at: https://pypi.org/project/funding-service-design-utils/

## Updating the release workflow
- If making changes to the release flow etc, you can publish to test.pypi.org when testing. To do this, update the `Publish to PyPI` step with the following:
```
    - name: Publish to PyPI
      id: publish-to-pypi
      uses: pypa/gh-action-pypi-publish@release/v1
      with:
        password: ${{ secrets.PYPI_API_TOKEN_TEST }}
        repository_url: https://test.pypi.org/legacy/
```
- That will publish packages to https://test.pypi.org/project/funding-service-design-utils/ instead, without updating the index of the main PyPI repo.
- Don't forget to change it back when you're done!

# Usage
Either of the following options will install the funding-service-design-utils into your python project. The package `fsd_utils` can then be imported.
## Released version
To reference a particular tag from pip, add the following to your `requirements.txt` file or use `pip install` (update version as appropriate):

    funding-service-design-utils==0.0.1

## Latest / in-dev version
To reference the latest commit from a particular branch from pip, add the following to your `requirements.txt` file or use `pip install`:

    git+https://github.com/communitiesuk/funding-service-design-utils.git@<branchName>

## Local changes
When working and testing locally, you can also install the `fsd_utils` package from your local filesystem:

    pip uninstall -y funding-service-design-utils
    pip install /path/to/your/working/directory/funding-service-design/utils

# Utilities

## The configclass
Currently the configclass allows for pretty print debugging of config keys and the class from which they are created. This allows devs to quickly diagnoise problems arrising from incorrectly set config. To activate this functionality, one must decorate each config class with the `@configclass` decorator.

## Common Config
This defines config values that are common across different services, eg. url patterns. Usage example:

```
from fsd_utils import CommonConfig

@configclass
class DefaultConfig:
    SECRET_KEY = CommonConfig.SECRET_KEY

```

## Gunicorn
The gunicorn utility allows consistent configuration of gunicorn across microservices.

To use it,
First - add run/gunicorn directory in your application with config scripts that import the appropriate config from this util's choice of config files eg.

    # in run/gunicorn/local.py
    from fsd_utils.gunicorn.config.local import *  # noqa

Then - add a wsgi.py script to the root of your application eg.

    # in wsgi.py
    from app import app

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        app.run()

Finally - To run with gunicorn, call the gunicorn command in your manifest.yml's or in the terminal, passing the wsgi application and the appropriate configuration file as arguments eg.

in the terminal:

    gunicorn wsgi:app -c run/gunicorn/dev.py

in a manifest file:

    # manifest-dev.yml
    ---
    applications:
        ...
        command: gunicorn wsgi:app -c run/gunicorn/devtest.py

## Logging
The logging utility formats logs to a consistent format (text in development and json in other environments).
The utility also supports logging from gunicorn

To use it add the following to your flask create_app factory

    from fsd_utils.logging import logging

    def create_app():
        ...
        # Initialise logging
        logging.init_app(flask_app)

and in your env config classes, specify the log level you want to report eg.:

    @configclass
    class DefaultConfig(object):
        ...
        # Logging
        FSD_LOG_LEVEL = logging.WARNING

## Authentication
The authentication utility provides a consistent authentication functions including a `@login_required` decorator that can be used to restrict routes that should only be accessible to authenticated users.

To use the utility:
First - ensure that the following environment variables are set to the appropriate values eg.:

    FSD_USER_TOKEN_COOKIE_NAME = "fsd_user_token"
    AUTHENTICATOR_HOST = "https://funding-service-design-authenticator-dev.london.cloudapps.digital"
    RSA256_PUBLIC_KEY = "{RSA PUBLIC KEY}"

NOTE: These values (and keys) need to be shared/common across all microservices that use each common authenticator host. If any of the environment *keys* for each of these attributes needs to be modified these can be reconfigured in fsd_utils/authentication/config.py.

Then - to use the `@login_required` decorator just add it to routes you need to protect eg:

    # in ...routes.py
    from fsd_utils.authentication.decorators import login_required

    @login_required
    def example_route(account_id):
        #...account_id will be available here if the user is authenticated
        #...if not logged in the user will be redirected to re-authenticate

## Healthchecks
Adds the route `/healthcheck` to an application. On hitting this endpoint, a customisable set of checks are run to confirm the application is functioning as expected and a JSON response is returned.

Response codes:
- 200: All checks were successful, application is healthy
- 500: One or more checks failed, application is unhealthy

Example usage:
```
from fsd_utils.healthchecks.healthcheck import Healthcheck
from fsd_utils.healthchecks.checkers import DbChecker, FlaskRunningChecker

health = Healthcheck(flask_app)
health.add_check(FlaskRunningChecker())
health.add_check(DbChecker(db))
```
The above will initialise the `/healthcheck` url and adds 2 checks.

### Checks
The following 2 checks are provided in `fsd_utils` in `checkers.py`:
- `FlaskRunningChecker`: Checks whether a `current_app` is available from flask, returns `True` if it is, `False` if not.
- `DbChecker`: Runs a simple query against the DB to confirm database availability.

### Implementing custom checks
Custom checks can be created as subclasses of `CheckerInterface` and should contain a method with the following signature:
`def check(self) -> Tuple[bool, str]:`
Where
- `bool` is a True or False whether the check was successful
- `str` is a message to display in the result JSON, typically `OK` or `Fail`

## Translations
Multiple language support is provided by `flask-babel`. Docs here: https://python-babel.github.io/flask-babel/#

### Python Setup
The python setup relies on 2 methods and an initialisation. In `create_app` we initialise `babel` on our app:

    from fsd_utils.locale_selector.get_lang import get_lang

    babel = Babel(flask_app)
    babel.locale_selector_func = get_lang
    LanguageSelector(flask_app)

The `get_lang()` function reads the user-selected language from a cookie (if set by `LanguageSelector` - see below), or if that is not present uses a built-in function of babel to negotiate the language based on the request headers and the supported languages.

`LanguageSelector` creates an additional route `/language/<language>` that sets the user's selected language in a cookie. Used the cookie rather than the session so it can be shared across the microservices.

Set `COOKIE_DOMAIN` on the app to the domain you want to set the cookie on.

### Creating Translations
1. Add `trans` tags around items in your jinja html file that you want to translate. What's contained in the `trans` tag should be the english version of this text. eg:

        A greeting is: {% trans %}Good Morning{% endtrans %}

1. Generate a new translations template file (`messages.pot`)

        pybabel extract -F babel.cfg -o messages.pot .

1. If initialising a new set of translations for a new repo or adding a new language, use `init`. *This will override any changes already made in the `translations` directory!*

        # Initialise a welsh translations file in app/translations
        pybabel init -i messages.pot -d app/translations -l cy
    The directory supplied to `-d` (eg. `app/translations`) must sit at the same level as the `templates` folder, in our case within the `app` directory. This command generates a new `messages.po` file in `translations/cy/LC_MESSAGES/` Where `cy` is the language code. (cy = Welsh/Cymraeg)

1. If you've added new strings to an existing template, or added new templates after running `init`, use `update`:

        pybabel update -i messages.pot -d app/translations

    This will append new strings to the existing `messages.po` file, preserving any translations you already have in there.

1. To add translations for strings, edit the `messages.po` file.

        #: app/templates/index.html:10
        msgid "Good Morning"
        msgstr "Bore da"

    where `msgid` is the english version of the string from the original template file, and `msgstr` is the translation of the string.

1. Once the translations are ready, use `compile` to generate the binary for use at runtime:

        pybabel compile -d app/translations

##Â Sentry
Enables Sentry integration.

* Before the flask app is created initialise Sentry using
```
from fsd_utils import init_sentry

init_sentry()
```
* Set the `SENTRY_DSN` environment variable on the app
